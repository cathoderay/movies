# movies


## quick start

In order to get started, run:
```shell
 $ curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cathoderay/movies/master/run.sh | bash
```
This script assumes you have *git*, *virtualenv* and *pip* installed. I suggest you to read it before running. If you trust me, you can run it anyway, =)

## todo
   * In order to scale, this code should migrate from python to js. Using angularjs + pagination will improve its performance a lot; Unfortunately, I didn't have the time to make it work yet;
   * Write tests!
